* Mini Government Centers (MGCs)
  * An MGC is a designated area that acts as a local beacon for government and public services. Essentially, all the basic government services operate around the MGC. Designated services could include:
    * Post office drop offs
    * Library book drop offs
    * Bus statios
    * Miniature parks
    * Community gardens & free fruits/vegetables zone
  * Every person should be within a 10 minute walking distance of an MGC.
* Large Government Center (LGCs)
  * An LGC is a building that serves as a focal point for more government services that requires people to actively work there. LGC services may include:
    * Police stations
    * Libraries
    * Schools
    * Daycare
    * Medical offices
    * Information centers
    * Banks
    * Utilities offices
    * Real estate purchasing offices
    * Tax, organisation, compliance offices
    * Voting centers
    * Telecommunications purchasing offices
    * Shopping/commercial centers
  * An LGC should exist for every approximately 1,000-10,000 people.
  * LGC services will change depending on the size of the area that they cover.
* Modernism has infested itself (for better or worse) into nearly all aspects of the state. Therefore, many try to categorize Lumina as being left or right, etc. Rather, we form our government identity purely based on a rejection of these labels, following instead postmodernist philosophy. The goal of the state and the body politic in the Luminian sense is to help and protect the people, whether through not acting in certain respects is helpful (as in the libertarian or conservative view) or through specific action. We are also not exactly liberal, althought this term is so broad it literally envelops many aspects of modern conservatism and leftism and is really so dominant that it is almost post-ideological. Liberals often accept the duty of the body politic to both defend the person, property, and contract (the traditional liberal philosophy) and to support those in desparity (the Keynesian or new liberal philosophy). We also propose a 3rd point, an extension or replacement of the new liberal philosophy to a degree: the response to natural monopoly, and as well, a response to exploitation and the somewhat inherent contradictions of capitalism and the free market. Traditional modernist philosophy has a specific target as the target of its exploits: liberalism and conservatism with the (typically elite, educated, landowning, propertyowning, white, male, cis, straight) citizen, nationalism and fascism with the nation, member of race, or *citizen* (often as a euphamism for the member of the race), leftism with the worker or oppressed, etc. We aim our idea on the median person; and therefore all policy implemented is aimed to benefit the average person in Lumina – a People's Government. The Government will engage in economic planning insofar as it benefits the common person. We seek a compromise between individuality and collectivism/community – respect right, law, individual choice, free enterprise, but recognize how a community and working together is in the common benefit.
