# Municipal Environmental Strategy
Published by the Ministry of the Environment
## Section 1: Executive Summary
Lumina is hoping to be seen as a global standard in terms of its environmental strategy. Building a new city from scratch in a way that fully supports living with the planet is easier than repurposing an entire city that already exists. This environmental strategy, and the objective goal of being recognized as an environmental leader will support populization of the city and encourage environmental and social justice minded settlers that will help develop the social systems of the city in a progressive manner, allowing the city to be seen as a world hub of experimental, direct democratic, social, popular, minimalist governance.

This strategy is developed in accordance with the 5 Year Plans published by the Ministry of the Economy. The 5 Year Plans are subservient to this strategy and should be developed with the Municipal Environmental Strategy in mind at all times.
