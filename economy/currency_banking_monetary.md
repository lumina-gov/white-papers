## Introduction:

As a new and rapidly growing city-state, Lumina is committed to building a strong and stable economy that can support the needs and aspirations of its citizens. In order to achieve this goal, Lumina is developing a comprehensive and innovative currency, banking, and monetary system that will support the growth and development of our community.

In this whitepaper, we will outline the key features and components of Lumina's currency, banking, and monetary system, and explain how it will support the growth and stability of our economy.

## Currency:

The currency of Lumina is the Aura, which is a 100% digital currency with no physical notes or coins. Auras are based on a single, unified exchange rate.

In order to ensure the stability and value of the Aura, Lumina has established an exchange pool of foreign reserves that are used to give the currency a minimum value. This exchange pool is managed by the government and is designed to ensure that the value of the Aura remains stable.

Aura can also be purchased from the government at a set rate determined by Lumina Bank.

## Banking:

Lumina has a comprehensive digitized banking system, and will provide services such as deposits, loans, virtual cards, Apple Pay, and other mobile banking services.

Lumina has integrated with Stripe to provide citizens with virtual cards, which can be used to make purchases and payments anywhere in the world. Apple Pay is also supported, allowing citizens to make secure and convenient payments with their Apple devices

## Exchange System:

Lumina also has a system for exchange of currency with buy/sell orders. This system provides citizens with the ability to purchase and sell Auras directly from the government exchange pool, as well as from other citizens and businesses. This will provide citizens with greater liquidity and flexibility when it comes to exchanging their currency.

The exchange pool will have money injected into it through revenue from government services, such as Lumina's education platform, Light University.


## Monetary System:

Lumina has a comprehensive monetary system that is designed to keep the value of the Aura stable. This system includes a number of elements, such as a reserve pool of foreign currencies, a central bank, and a monetary policy committee.

The reserve pool of foreign currencies is managed by the government and is designed to ensure that the value of the Aura remains stable. The central bank is responsible for setting interest rates and controlling the money supply. The monetary policy committee is responsible for setting the monetary policy of the country.

The central bank and monetary policy committee will work together to ensure that the value of the Aura remains stable and that the economy of Lumina remains healthy. 

## Conclusion:

Lumina's currency, banking, and monetary system is designed to provide stability and flexibility to the citizens of Lumina. With the introduction of the Aura, citizens will have access to a reliable and secure currency, as well as access to banking services and a comprehensive exchange system. The central bank and monetary policy committee will also ensure that the value of the Aura remains stable and that the economy of Lumina remains healthy.
