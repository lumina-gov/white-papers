# Whitepaper: The Currency, Banking, and Monetary System of Lumina

## Introduction

As a new and rapidly growing city-state, Lumina is committed to building a strong and stable economy that can support the needs and aspirations of its citizens. In order to achieve this goal, Lumina is developing a comprehensive and innovative currency, banking, and monetary system that will support the growth and development of our community.

In this whitepaper, we will outline the key features and components of Lumina's currency, banking, and monetary system, and explain how it will support the growth and stability of our economy.

## Currency

The currency of Lumina is the Aura, which is a 100% digital currency with no physical notes or coins. Auras are based on a single, unified exchange rate.

In order to ensure the stability and value of the Aura, Lumina has established an exchange pool of foreign reserves that are used to give the currency a minimum value. This exchange pool is managed by the government and is designed to ensure that the value of the Aura remains stable.

Aura can also be purchased from the government at a set rate determined by Lumina Bank.

## Banking

Lumina has a comprehensive digitized banking system, and will provide services such as deposits, loans, virtual cards, Apple Pay, and other mobile banking services.

Lumina has integrated with Stripe to provide citizens with virtual cards, which can be used to make purchases and payments anywhere in the world. Apple Pay is also supported, allowing citizens to make secure and convenient payments with their Apple devices

## Exchange System

Lumina also has a system for exchange of currency with buy/sell orders. This system provides citizens with the ability to purchase and sell Auras directly from the government exchange pool, as well as from other citizens and businesses. This will provide citizens with greater liquidity and flexibility when it comes to exchanging their currency.

The exchange pool will have money injected into it through revenue from government services, such as Lumina's education platform, Light University.


## Monetary System

Lumina has a comprehensive monetary system that is designed to keep the value of the Aura stable. This system includes a number of elements, such as a reserve pool of foreign currencies, the sovereign wealth fund(s), precious metal reserves, a central bank, and a monetary policy committee.

Lumina will have control over the supply of its currency and will use the foreign currency supplies to manage the demand to provide currency stability. Quantitative easing - the selective addition and removal of supply - can be used as an alternative for and in addition to fractional-reserve lending. Advanced statistics such as currency velocity will be used to quantify potential future currency value. Lumina aims for an inflation goal of 2%. In effect, currency and currency liquidity can be provided at will to meet demand or for any beneficial purpose.

The reserve pool of foreign currencies is managed by the government and is designed to ensure that the value of the Aura remains stable. The central bank is responsible for setting interest rates and controlling the money supply. The monetary policy committee is responsible for setting the monetary policy of the country. The open market operations (OMO) committee is tasked with managing OMO.

The central bank and monetary policy committee will work together to ensure that the value of the Aura remains stable and that the economy of Lumina remains healthy.

## Debt

Lumina will use debt selectively and solely for the process of development of the city, such as for investment into infrastructure, development of institutions, and other productive purposes. It should not be used for programs of limited benefit or for the provision of transfer payments. Responsible debt limits should be instituted, such as a soft cap of 50% of GDP. Debt is secondarily used as a tool of monetary policy through the open market operations committee.

## Conclusion

Lumina's currency, banking, and monetary system is designed to provide stability and flexibility to the citizens of Lumina. With the introduction of the Aura, citizens will have access to a reliable and secure currency, as well as access to banking services and a comprehensive exchange system. The central bank and monetary policy committee will also ensure that the value of the Aura remains stable and that the economy of Lumina remains healthy.
